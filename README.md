# 👋 Hi, I’m Job DC

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a Data Analyst stacking skills to break into the world of data. I truly believe that data is the future—with AI on the rise, companies are in a race to make the smartest decisions, and data is their fuel. Those who know how to `clean`, `manage`, `analyze`, and `visualize` data are the ones shaping the world.

Right now, I'm on a journey to level up my SQL, Python, and data viz skills so I can turn raw numbers into real insights. The goal? To help businesses make smarter moves and stay ahead in the data game. Let's get it! 🚀

## 🧠 My Tech Stack

🔹 SQL – Crafting queries like a data wizard!\
🐍 Python – Data manipulation, automation, and storytelling with code.\
📊 Power BI & Tableau – Turning raw numbers into beautiful, interactive dashboards. `(Not yet learned XD)`\
🗄️ Databases – PostgreSQL, MySQL, and beyond. `(Still unpolished)`\
💻 Excel – Because sometimes, old-school is still cool.

## 🎯 Why Data Analytics?
In today's fast-paced world, data is the new oil. Companies are battling through data, and those who can manage, handle, clean, extract, analyze, visualize, and interpret data are the ones shaping the future. I want to be part of this transformation—helping businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions that improve processes, enhance efficiency, and drive growth.
